# Node Blog 

this is an application  which lets users write blog entries once they sign up with an account

After the user registers, he can go to the homepage and login with his credentials.

The navigation bar will dynamically show different items depending on the user being logged in or out.This  will be achieved  using the EJS template engine.

Once logged in, the navigation bar will have a "LogOut"  item. There will also be a "New Post" item where the user can create a new blog post

When he goes back to the Home page, his blog entries will be posted there with the username and date posted

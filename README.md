# Blog-node.js

i will build a blog app which lets users write blog entries once they sign up
with an account

After the user registers, he can go to the homepage and login with his
credentials.

The navigation bar will dynamically show different items depending on the user being logged in or out. We will achieve this using the EJS template engine.

Once logged in, the navigation bar will have a "LogOut" item. There will also be a "New Post" item where the user can create a
new blog post and upload an associated image file., When he goes back to the Home page, his blog entries will be posted there with the username and date posted
